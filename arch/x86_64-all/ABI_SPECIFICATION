Caller-side

Type of call            How base is fetched at caller                  ==>                  How base and arguments are passed to library
REGCALL
  inline
    regular             Passed to inline function as result of __aros_getbase_LibBase()     R12 for base    / SysV x86_64 ABI for arguments
                        defined by default to (LibBase) global or local variable.
                        (LibBase) can be re-defined by caller.

  define
    regular             Passed to macro as result of __aros_getbase_LibBase()               R12 for base    / SysV x86_64 ABI for arguments
                        defined by default to (LibBase) global or local variable.
                        (LibBase) cab be re-defined by caller.

    base-relative       Passed to macro as result of __aros_getbase_LibBase()               R12 for base    / SysV x86_64 ABI for arguments
                        defined by default as result of __aros_getoffsettable() offsetted
                        by __aros_rellib_offset_LibBase global constant. Caller must
                        implement or define __aros_getoffsettable() returning
                        caller's library base.

  linklib
    regular             Fetched in stub function as results of                              R12 for base    / SysV x86_64 ABI for arguments
                        __aros_getbase_LibBase() which is compiled as (LibBase) global
                        variable. Re-defining (LibBase) by caller has no effect, as
                        stub function is already compiled.

                        global constant. Caller must implement __aros_getoffsettable()
                        returning caller's library base.

    varargs
      regular           Fetched by compiled-in reading of (LibBase) global variable.        R12 for base    / SysV x86_64 ABI for arguments
                        Re-defining (LibBase) by caller has no effect, as stub function is

    unusedlibbase
      regular           Fetched by compiled-in reading of (LibBase) global variable.        Base not passed / SysV x86_64 ABI for arguments
                        Re-defining (LibBase) by caller has no effect, as stub function is
                        already compiled.
