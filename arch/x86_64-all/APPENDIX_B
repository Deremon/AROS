Appendix B: Interrupt handler code and Software interrupts code
===============================================================

Code that is executed in context of an interrupt, be it a hardware interrupt handler routine or a software interrupt, needs to preserve XMM
and YMM registers 4 through 15. General purpose registers and XMM and YMM registers 0 through 3 are guaranteed to be preserved by system
and can be freely used by handler code.

In the case where handler code calls into a system function, it is guaranteed that the system function will follow this logic and will
preserve XMM and YMM registers 4 through 15.

In the case where handler code calls into other (3rd party) code, the author of the handler code needs to review the complete call chain
to guarantee above rule is met. As a workaround for review, the author of the handler can compile all the code with -mgeneral-regs-only
switch which guarantees that any possible compiler optimization (like vectorization, loop unroll) is not using XMM or YMM registers.
